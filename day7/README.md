# Employee Website

Creating a simple html website to display employee.

The Employee List are added dynamically.

In the Emplyoee.js file, 1st we are defining constant of emplyoee details.

Then we are creating the display function; where it takes the array of all employee details and create a new div element for each employ and we are appending it the main div in the html doc.

then we create a function totoggle the active and inactive status in the document.

then we are displaying; sorting based on their names.

also we are logging it in the console logs
